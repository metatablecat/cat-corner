Hey, you may have (or may not have) noticed that I've moved away from Discord, and also that I've deleted my Mastodon account on tech.lgbt.

## Why

I've recently had a massive wave of paranoia and anxiety thats gotten to the point where I cant really manage it easily anymore, to my friends on Discord, I've kept this friend list short anyway, so you should still be able to contact me, but I'm no longer in any servers.

I may start to prune friends from here as well soon unless you're a close friend that I trust personally.

## Roblox and GitHub

I'll continue to make stuff on Roblox and GitHub, game development is a passion for me so its a bit weird that I would close these accounts.

I wouldn't work on Catwork for 5-6 months just to abandon it over paranoia.

## Contacting me

As stated earlier, if you're a friend on Discord, you can still contact me as normal (i probably sent you this, or you went to my website and clicked on the href)

For everyone else, you can continue to contact me on the DevForum as I always have, be aware that I may be jumpier or more confrontational than normal.

## Closing

This is no one's fault, just my own, its anxiety from past events thats built up into paranoia, and this is the best way for me to manage it.
