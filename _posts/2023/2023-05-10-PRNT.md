I felt like dropping a little guide on how to read the `PRNT` chunk in an RBXM file, this is documented, however I'd felt like I'd showcase how to read it in a slightly different way.

This assumes you already know how RBXM stores `Referent` and interleaving as a concept.

Lets assume we have a basic folder structure like this:

![image](https://github.com/tfilteredc/blog/assets/132796135/90b5e1c5-8490-4877-a17d-8daec1fd38af)

When this gets packed into the `PRNT` chunk, it could look like this in HEX (uncompressed)

```
00 08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 02 03
08 01 04 02 0D 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 02 00 01
08 07 00 00 01
```

The first five bytes are just used to denote the version (always `00`) and the number of Refs in the `PRNT` chunk. The remaining bytes are two arrays of referents.
> While I haven't observed this myself, it may be possible that multiple `PRNT` chunks could appear, since the chunk contains a `Referent` count.

Once thats been deinterleaved and parsed, we'll end up with two tables of `Referent` types.

```lua
local child_refs =  {2, 3, 1, 5, 4, 6, 7, 0}
local parent_refs = {1, 1, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, -1}
```

Its worth noting that we should also map each `Folder` above in the image to their `Referent` ID.
```
Folder1 - 0
  Folder2 - 1
    Folder3 - 2
    Folder4 - 3
  Folder5 - 4
    Folder6 - 5
  Folder7 - 6
  Folder8 - 7
```

An index in a `child_ref` and `parent_ref` table creates a link where

```lua
child_refs[i].Parent = parent_refs[i]
```

Or in another way, this can be visualised with a table like this:

|child_ref|child_ref_instance|parent_ref|parent_ref_instance|
|---------|------------------|----------|-------------------|
|`0`      |Folder1           |`-1`      |`<<<ROOT>>>`       |
|`1`      |Folder2           |`0`       |Folder1            |
|`2`      |Folder3           |`1`       |Folder2            |
|`3`      |Folder4           |`1`       |Folder2            |
|`4`      |Folder5           |`0`       |Folder1            |
|`5`      |Folder6           |`4`       |Folder5            |
|`6`      |Folder7           |`0`       |Folder1            |
|`7`      |Folder8           |`0`       |Folder1            |

If a `Referent` is `< 0` then it should be parented to the root of the tree.

You can use a script like this to build the tree from these lists
```lua
for i = 1, count_of_refs do
  local child_ref = child_refs[count_of_refs]
  local parent_ref = child_refs[count_of_refs]

  local child = referents[child_ref]
  local parent = if parent_ref >= 0 then referents[parent_ref].Children or TREE_ROOT
  
  table.insert(parent, child)
end
```
